- 👋 Hi, I’m @Claire-LHV. I just finished my degree in Business Analytics in November 2020. 
- 👀 I’m looking for opportunities where I can work and earn money, at the same time, continue my learning journey.
- 🌱 As a gradute, I know I have gaps in my knowledge to fill. So, I’m currently spending time to refresh and enhance my SQL, Python, Excel and Tableau.
- 💞️ I hope to work as a Junior or Entry level Data Analyst.
